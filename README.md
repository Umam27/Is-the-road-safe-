## Recruitment Task Details :-
### I have implemented an SVM classifier model on a data that shows who are the potential buyers of any particular product.
### My code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook

### Answer to question B:
#### I have taken the data from Kaggle - [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads)
#### Data Name - Social Networking Ads
#### This data contains 5 columns and 400 rows
#### More description of the data can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.


### Answer to question C:
#### I have chosen this SVM classifier because in this data set the number of features is high and the data points in the dataset is low. SVM classifier is a supervised classification method which helps in detecting outliers. It is an easy to implement and gives accurate predictions. It is best used for data with high number of features. There are two types of SVM classifiers, Linear and Non Linear. We can use kernal Linear and kernal rbf respectively. I have implemented linear, because it shows a clear boundary between the two data areas. 

## Assignment - 1 :-

### We have been given a model, we have to add comments about what every line of code does.
### The solution to the assignment is contained in the sub-folder named "Assignment-1" - in the jupyter notebook named "task1.ipynb".
